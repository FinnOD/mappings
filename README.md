# ðŸ—º MAPPINGS v0.0.1

## Mapping and Analysis of Phosphorylation Pathways Identified through Network/Graph Signalling

Mappings is a tool for blah blah. 

It analyses kinexus chip data to find..

Maybe put a picture here or something. The sky is the limit.

First described by our names here: (Not the real article, but just showing you can put links)

[Network analysis of large phospho-signalling datasets: application to Plasmodium-erythrocyte interactions](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.443051v1)

and it looked pretty good doing it!

Designed and programmed with love by Dr. Jack Adderley and Finn O'Donoghue.
